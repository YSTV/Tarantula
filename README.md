###Building

Build Tarantula by issuing the `make` command inside the project directory.
Tarantula requires gcc-4.7 or above.

###Using Tarantula

The default configuration enables several demo plugins and provides a simple
user interface to add schedule events to the system. Additional plugins may
be enabled in the config_base/ directory.

Run `bin/Tarantula` after the build has completed to start the system. Then
visit http://localhost:9816/ in a browser to access the web user interface.
Events added in the web interface will be executed and the results will 
appear in the log (demo plugins do nothing but write to the log).

Tarantula is free software, anybody is welcome to extend it, for example by
writing plugins to complement the default set. To keep track of development
