  Using Tarantula
  ---------------
  
  The default configuration enables several demo plugins and provides a simple
  user interface to add schedule events to the system. Additional plugins may
  be enabled in the config_base/ directory.

  visit http://localhost:9816/ in a browser to access the web user interface.
  Events added in the web interface will be executed and the results will 
  appear in the log (demo plugins do nothing but write to the log).
